This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Installing nvm

This project currently uses node `v22`. The node version is managed by the `.nvmrc` and [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file) to help keep contributers insync. It's highly encouraged to install nvm prior to working in this project to avoid any package.lock versioning issues. [Follow the install instructions here to install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating)

Once nvm is properly installed, run `nvm use` in your terminal to switch to the current nvm version.

### Running locally

1. Make sure all dependencies are up to date by running `npm install`
2. run `npm run dev`
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Accessing the CMS

We use [sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) for a content management system. This allows our content administrators to add and update providers and services within our system. Sanity provides us with a prebuilt CMS UI as well as database and query tools.

1. Setup a sanity account. You will need to be invited to the project.
2. Access the CMS locally at [http://localhost:3000/studio](http://localhost:3000/studio)

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
