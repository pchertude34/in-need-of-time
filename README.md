This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Installing nvm

This project currently uses node `v22`. The node version is managed by the `.nvmrc` and [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file) to help keep contributers insync. It's highly encouraged to install nvm prior to working in this project to avoid any package.lock versioning issues. [Follow the install instructions here to install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating)

Once nvm is properly installed, run `nvm use` in your terminal to switch to the current nvm version.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
